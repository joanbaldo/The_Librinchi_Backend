## Brief intro 📅
[⬆️](#index)

>*This project aims to create a complete backend system using an online store as target to develope the logic and code behind*

> __Note__
Some suggestions to include extra features have been detailed in the table below.

## Milestones 📅
[⬆️](#index)

| HTML JS CSS     | Milestone |
| :-----------:   | :---------- |
|HTML               | Create the forms to directly input the data     |
|JS           | Create the promises structure to replace postman for real form inputs.     |
|HTML               | Prepare layout to create CARDS for the products


> __Note__
Coding priorities have been re-checked almost daily in order to speed up project development.


## Future upgrades ✅
[⬆️](#index)

>Things to do
>- [ ] Create SPA to nest front-end forms and inputs 
>- [ ] Create a card system to show the products
>- [ ] Export orders in pdf


## HTML notes 📋
[⬆️](#index)

>*Due its backend nature, no html suport is needed.*

## JS notes 📋
[⬆️](#index)

>*JS has been used entirely to execute NODE JS which is the real handler of the code behind the server.*

## NODE JS notes 📋
[⬆️](#index)

>*Node framework has been the key piece to build up the server.*

## CSS notes 📋
[⬆️](#index)

>*Till frontend be created, CSS won't came into the game.*

## Sequelize notes 📋
[⬆️](#index)

>*To bring MySQL database queries to the backend, I've used this ORM which has pretty methods built within to handle tables. *

## MySQL notes 📋
[⬆️](#index)

>*Due the implementation of Sequelize in the backend development workflow, MySQL has only been accessed through the Workbench graphic interface tool, to check up Sequelize migrations and tables content. Tables linking has been fully managed within Sequelize,not using the "model" tool.*
