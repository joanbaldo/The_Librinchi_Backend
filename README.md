## HTML notes 📋
[⬆️](#index)

>*Due its backend nature, no html suport is needed.*

## JS notes 📋
[⬆️](#index)

>*JS has been used entirely to execute NODE JS which is the real handler of the code behind the server.*

## NODE notes 📋
[⬆️](#index)

>*Node framework has been the key piece to build up the server.*

## CSS notes 📋
[⬆️](#index)

>*Till frontend be created, CSS won't came into the game.*

## Sequelize notes 📋
[⬆️](#index)

>*To bring MySQL database queries to the backend, I've used this ORM which has pretty methods built within to handle tables. *

## MySQL notes 📋
[⬆️](#index)

>*Due the implementation of Sequelize in the backend development workflow, MySQL has only been accessed through the Workbench graphic interface tool, to check up Sequelize migrations and tables content. Tables linking has been fully managed within Sequelize,not using the "model" tool.*
